# Basic string exercises
# Fill in the code for the functions below. main() is already set up
# to call the functions with a few different inputs,
# printing 'OK' when each function is correct.
# The starter code for each function includes a 'return'
# which is just a placeholder for your code.
# It's ok if you do not complete all the functions, and there
# are some additional functions to try in string2.py.
